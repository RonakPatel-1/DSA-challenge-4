# DSA-challenge-4
File Recovery Algorithm

For this challenge let us take ubuntu as OS and try the program on that.

Pre-req - 
1. download and try the attached code on ubuntu and use latest python 3.9.x to run.
2. Make sure you have installed SleuthKit in ubuntu before you run the programm
3. Also make sure you have some USB drive mounted and we will try to recover the files
4. Just to make sure unallocated or deleted partitions won't be recovered
5. Run the code and follow the instructions:


Let us see below is the contents availble in USB when mounted on ubuntu:

Let us delete some files to test:

Now let us run the python code and see the output

Now this will ask you to select the device name and image name 

Once you select then it will ask for user authentication. See below snap:

After you enter password it will check and take some time and will depend the file and size of recovery, so have patience and plz wait :) !!
